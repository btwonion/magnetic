## Fabric & Paper
- change `ignoreRangedWeapons` to `ignoredEntitiesRangeMin`
  - now the ignored drops are calculated by the distance the mob has died in comparison to the player
  - if the value is -1, no check will be performed
  - type: double, default: 15.0
- introduce `conditionStatement` to replace old requirements
  - now you can use logical statements to check if a player should be able to use magnetic
  - the statement will be processed from start to end, so no weight of operators will be respected
  - if the String is empty, no checks will be applied
  - Operators: AND (&&), OR (||)
  - Conditions: ENCHANTMENT, SNEAK, PERMISSION
  - default: "ENCHANTMENT"
