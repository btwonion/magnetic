## Both loaders
- update default config values [**#66**](https://github.com/btwonion/magnetic/issues/66)
  - ignoredEntitiesRangeMin: 15 -> 50
  - titleAlert - enabled: true -> false
- capitalize enchantment names everywhere [**#64**](https://github.com/btwonion/magnetic/issues/64)
- do not animate items when the player's inventory is full [**#65**](https://github.com/btwonion/magnetic/issues/65)

## Paper
